and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Breaking change in experimental features**: Multiband support is introduced for features implemented in Python. It changes class inheritance interface in a backward-incompatible way
- `light-curve[full]` extras which installs all optional Python dependencies required by experimental features
- Experimental `RainbowFit` feature for fitting multiband light curves with a single model, Russeil+23 in prep. It requires Python 3.8 or later because of `iminuit` dependency
- Optional `iminuit>=2,<3` dependency (included into `[full]`) for `RainbowFit` feature

### Changed

- **Breaking change in experimental features** `scipy` dependency is now optional for experimental features implemented in Python
- **Breaking change in experimental features**: All experimental features implemented in Python require keyword-only arguments in their constructors. Also, all names of the arguments are changed to be the same as for Rust features
- **Build breaking**: "abi3-py310" Cargo feature is replaced with "abi3-py311". "abi3" feature is now linked to "abi3-py311" feature. This is because our aim with ABI is to support future versions of Python
- **Build breaking**: minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) is changed from 1.62 to 1.67 (released 2023-01-26)
- Bump `light-curve-feature` 0.5.5 -> 0.6.0
- Bump `pyO3` 0.18.3 -> 0.19.1, it simplified signature generations for classes https://github.com/light-curve/light-curve-python/pull/230
- Bump `rust-numpy` 0.18.0 -> 0.19.0 https://github.com/light-curve/light-curve-python/pull/230
- Bump `thiserror` 1.0.41 -> 1.0.48 https://github.com/light-curve/light-curve-python/pull/242

## [0.7.3] 2023-07-06

### Added

- All Rust features got `.to_json()` method to serialize their state to JSON string. https://github.com/light-curve/light-curve-python/pull/226
- New special Rust feature `JSONDeserializedFeature` and a helper function `feature_from_json()` to deserialize features from JSON string. https://github.com/light-curve/light-curve-python/pull/226
- Build: "abi3" and "abi3-py310" Cargo features (the least one is enabled by the first one) to build a wheel for CPython 3.10+. This stable ABI wheel is less performant than the regular one, but it is compatible with all future Python versions. See [PEP 384](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0384/) for details. https://github.com/light-curve/light-curve-python/issues/79

### Changed

- **Build breaking**: the only Python build requirement `maturin` updated from v0.14.x to v1.0 https://github.com/light-curve/light-curve-python/pull/216 https://github.com/light-curve/light-curve-python/pull/215
- CI: bump cibuildwheel to 2.13.1 https://github.com/light-curve/light-curve-python/pull/225
- Bump `itertools` 0.10.5 -> 0.11.0 https://github.com/light-curve/light-curve-python/pull/224
- Bump `pyO3` 0.18.2 -> 0.18.3 https://github.com/light-curve/light-curve-python/pull/207

### Fixed

- Building from sdist on x86-64 macOS required manual setting of `$MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` to 10.9 or higher. Recent `maturin` update allowed us to specify it via `pyproject.toml`


## [0.7.2] 2023-04-12

### Added

- Feature transformations via `transform` constructor keyword. For most of the features it could accept string with a transformation name such as 'arcsinh' or 'clipped_lg', `True` or 'default' for the default transformation, `None` or `False` for no transformation https://github.com/light-curve/light-curve-python/issues/184 https://github.com/light-curve/light-curve-python/pull/188
- Binary wheels for x86_64 Windows built with no Ceres nor GSL features https://github.com/light-curve/light-curve-python/issues/12 https://github.com/light-curve/light-curve-python/pull/185
- `enum-iterator` crate dependency https://github.com/light-curve/light-curve-python/pull/188
- CI: code coverage with `codecov` https://github.com/light-curve/light-curve-python/pull/197
- Development: now project has extras for testing (`test`) and development (`dev`) https://github.com/light-curve/light-curve-python/pull/197

### Changed

- **Build breaking**: minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) is bump from 1.60 to 1.62
- Bump `light-curve-feature` 0.5.4 -> 0.5.5
- Bump `pyO3` 0.18.1 -> 0.18.2
- Most of the parametric features have default values for their parameters now, which, due to `pyO3` limitations, are not presented in the signatures, but documented in the docstrings. It also makes Python and Rust implementations more consistent https://github.com/light-curve/light-curve-python/issues/194 https://github.com/light-curve/light-curve-python/pull/195
- Development: switch from `pytest-markdown` to `markdown-pytest` which allowed us to use up-to-date pytest https://github.com/light-curve/light-curve-python/pull/198

### Deprecated

- `BazinFit` and `VillarFit` constructors will not accept `None` for `mcmc_niter`, `ceres_niter`, and `lmsder_niter` arguments in the future, just do not specify them to use defaults instead. https://github.com/light-curve/light-curve-python/pull/195
- `Periodogram` constructor will not accept `None` for `peaks`, `resolution`, `max_freq_factor`, `nyquist` and `fast` in the future, just do not specify them to use defaults instead. https://github.com/light-curve/light-curve-python/pull/195

### Fixed

- `Bins` feature had non-optimal lower boundary check for time series length: it checked if it is at least unity for any underlying features. Now it takes underlying feature requirements into account. It was fixed by updating `light-curve-feature` to v0.5.5.


## [0.7.1] 2023-03-17

### Fixed

- Bug introduced in v0.6.5: `*Fit.model(t, params)` wrongly checked `t` and `params` arrays to have the same length


## [0.7.0] 2023-03-16

### Added

- `BazinFit` and `VillarFit` have got `ceres` and `mcmc-ceres` algorithms using [Ceres Solver](http://ceres-solver.org) as a non-linear least squares optimizer. `ceres` is found to be more robust than `lmsder` algorithm (available via `gsl` Cargo feature) but working roughly twice slower. Ceres can be built from source (`ceres-source` Cargo feature, enabled by default in `Cargo.toml`) or linked to system library (`ceres-system` Cargo feature, enabled for cibuildwheel in `pyproject.toml`)

### Changed

- **API breaking:** Features' `__call__()` signature changed to make `sorted=None`, `check=True` and `fill_value=None` arguments to be keyword-only
- **API breaking:** Features' `many()` signature changed to make all arguments but the first `lcs` to be keyword-only
- **API breaking:** `Bins` constructor signature changed to make `offset` and `window` arguments to be keyword-only. For Rust implementation `__getnewargs__` is replaced with `__getnewargs_ex__`. Please note that for the specific case of Python implementation and Python version < 3.10, `Bins` still accepts positional arguments
- **API breaking:** `BazinFit` and `VillarFit` constructor signatures changed to make everything but the first `lcs` argument to be keyword-only
- **API breaking:** `Periodogram` constructor signature changed to make all arguments to be keyword-only
- **API breaking:** `DmDt` constructor signature changed to make all arguments but `dt` and `dm` to be keyword-only, `__getnewargs__` is replaced with `__getnewargs_ex__`. `DmDt.from_borders` class-method constructor has all arguments to be keyword-only
- **API breaking:** `DmDt` methods' signatures changed to make all arguments but data (like `t`, `t, m` or `lcs`) to be keyword-only
- **Build breaking:** building with Ceres Solver (`ceres-source` Cargo feature) is now a default, and potentially could break a building pipeline in some cases. If you want to build without Ceres Solver, you need to explicitly disable default features with `--no-default-features` maturin flag
- CI: switch from `macos-11` to `macos-latest` for testing
- Bump `pyo3` 0.17.3 -> 0.18.1
- Bump `rust-numpy` 0.17.2 -> 0.18.0

### Removed

- **Build breaking:** `fftw-static`, `fftw-dynamic`, `mkl` Cargo features are removed after deprecation in v0.6.2 and replaced with `fftw-source`, `fftw-system` and `fftw-mkl`.


## [0.6.6] 2023-03-17

### Fixed

- Bug introduced in v0.6.5: `*Fit.model(t, params)` wrongly checked `t` and `params` arrays to have the same length


## [0.6.5] 2023-02-22

### Fixed

- Reduce Rust-Python inter-op cost for numpy arrays significantly. It dropped from ~4 Î¼s per array to ~100ns. https://github.com/light-curve/light-curve-python/pull/174


## [0.6.4] 2023-01-19

### Added

- Initial `copy` and `pickle` (minimum protocol version is 2) support for feature extractors and `DmDt` https://github.com/light-curve/light-curve-python/issues/103 https://github.com/light-curve/light-curve-python/pull/145 https://github.com/light-curve/light-curve-python/pull/150
- `serde` v1 and `serde-pickle` v1 Rust dependencies. `serde-pickle` is an arbitrary choice of a (de)serialization binary format, but it could be useful in the future having a way to inspect Rust structures from Python https://github.com/light-curve/light-curve-python/pull/145

### Changed

- Build environment: minimum support Rust version (MSRV) is bumped 1.57 -> 1.60
- Bump `light-curve-dmdt` 0.6.0 -> 0.7.1

### Fixed

- `BazinFit` and `VillarFit` docs are clarified for `.model()` and `ln_prior` usage https://github.com/light-curve/light-curve-python/issues/125 https://github.com/light-curve/light-curve-python/pull/146

- `pyO3` 0.16.6 -> 0.17.3
- `rust-numpy` 0.16.2 -> 0.17.2
- CI: binary wheels are now built using our custom [manylinux/musllinux images](https://github.com/light-curve/base-docker-images), which include FFTW library optimised to use platform-specific SIMD instructions. It should give up to 50% performance gain for `Periodogram` at all Linux platforms but `x86_64` where we use MKL https://github.com/light-curve/light-curve-python/pull/134
- We don't provide binary wheels for Linux i686 anymore, please contact us if you need them https://github.com/light-curve/light-curve-python/pull/134
- wheel build dependency: `maturin` 0.13.x -> 0.14.x https://github.com/light-curve/light-curve-python/issues/130 https://github.com/light-curve/light-curve-python/pull/135
