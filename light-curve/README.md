# `light-curve` processing toolbox for Python

The Python wrapper for Rust [`light-curve-feature`](https://github.com/light-curve/light-curve-feature) and [`light-curve-dmdt`](https://github.com/light-curve/light-curve-dmdt) packages which gives a collection of high-performant time-series feature extractors.

## Installation

```sh
python3 -mpip install light-curve
```

We also provide `light-curve-python` package which is just an "alias" to the main `light-curve` package.

Minimum supported Python version is 3.7.

### Support matrix

| Arch \ OS   | Linux glibc | Linux musl | macOS | Windows    |
| ----------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | ---------- |
| **x86-64**  | wheel (MKL) | wheel (MKL) | wheel | not tested https://github.com/light-curve/light-curve-python/issues/12 |
| **i686**    | wheel       | not tested | — | not tested |
| **aarch64** | wheel       | src | src https://github.com/light-curve/light-curve-python/issues/5 | not tested |
| **ppc64le** | wheel       | not tested | — | — |

- "wheel": binary wheel is available on pypi.org, local building is not required for the platform, the only pre-requirement is a recent `pip` version. For Linux x86-64 we provide binary wheels built with Intel MKL for better periodogram perfromance, which is not a default build option.
- "src": the package is confirmed to be built and pass unit tests locally, but testing and package building is not supported by CI yet. It is required to have the [GNU scientific library (GSL)](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) v2.1+ and the [Rust toolchain](https://rust-lang.org) v1.57+ to install it via `pip install`.
- "not tested": building from the source code is not tested, please report us building status via issue/PR/email.

We build aarch64 macOS wheels locally running this command in `light-curve` directory:
```
rm -rf ./wheelhouse
CIBW_BUILD='cp3*-macosx_arm64' CIBW_ENVIRONMENT="MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=12.0 MATURIN_PEP517_ARGS='--cargo-extra-args=\"--locked --no-default-features --features fftw-dynamic,gsl\"'" CIBW_BEFORE_ALL='curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- --default-toolchain stable -y; brew install gsl fftw' python3 -mcibuildwheel --platform macos
twine upload wheelhouse/*.whl
```

## Feature evaluators

Most of the classes implement various feature evaluators useful for light-curve based
astrophysical source classification and characterisation.

```python
import light_curve as lc
import numpy as np

# Time values can be non-evenly separated but must be an ascending array
n = 101
t = np.linspace(0.0, 1.0, n)
perfect_m = 1e3 * t + 1e2
err = np.sqrt(perfect_m)
m = perfect_m + np.random.normal(0, err)

# Half-amplitude of magnitude
amplitude = lc.Amplitude()
# Fraction of points beyond standard deviations from mean
beyond_std = lc.BeyondNStd(nstd=1)
# Slope, its error and reduced chi^2 of linear fit
linear_fit = lc.LinearFit()
# Feature extractor, it will evaluate all features in more efficient way
extractor = lc.Extractor(amplitude, beyond_std, linear_fit)

# Array with all 5 extracted features
result = extractor(t, m, err, sorted=True, check=False)

print('\n'.join(f"{name} = {value:.2f}" for name, value in zip(extractor.names, result)))

# Run in parallel for multiple light curves:
results = amplitude.many(
    [(t[:i], m[:i], err[:i]) for i in range(n // 2, n)],
    n_jobs=-1,
    sorted=True,
    check=False,
)
print("Amplitude of amplitude is {:.2f}".format(np.ptp(results)))
```

If you confident in your inputs you could use `sorted = True` (`t` is in ascending order)
and `check = False` (no NaNs in inputs, no infs in `t` or `m`) for better performance.
Note that if your inputs are not valid and are not validated by
`sorted=None` and `check=True` (default values) then all kind of bad things could happen.

Print feature classes list
```python
import light_curve as lc

print([x for x in dir(lc) if hasattr(getattr(lc, x), "names")])
```

Read feature docs
```python
import light_curve as lc

help(lc.BazinFit)
```

### Experimental extractors

From the technical point of view the package consists of two parts: a wrapper for [`light-curve-feature` Rust crate](https://crates.io/crates/light-curve-feature) (`light_curve_ext` sub-package) and pure Python sub-package `light_curve_py`.
We use the Python implementation of feature extractors to test Rust implementation and to implement new experimental extractors.
Please note, that the Python implementation is much slower for the most of the extractors and doesn't provide the same functionality as the Rust implementation.
However, the Python implementation provides some new feature extractors you can find useful.

You can manually use extractors from both implementations:

```python
import numpy as np
from numpy.testing import assert_allclose
from light_curve.light_curve_ext import LinearTrend as RustLinearTrend
from light_curve.light_curve_py import LinearTrend as PythonLinearTrend

rust_fe = RustLinearTrend()
py_fe = PythonLinearTrend()

n = 100
t = np.sort(np.random.normal(size=n))
m = 3.14 * t - 2.16 + np.random.normal(size=n)

assert_allclose(rust_fe(t, m), py_fe(t, m),
                err_msg="Python and Rust implementations must provide the same result")
```

This should print a warning about experimental status of the Python class

## dm-dt map

Class `DmDt` provides dm–dt mapper (based on [Mahabal et al. 2011](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011BASI...39..387M/abstract), [Soraisam et al. 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...892..112S/abstract)). It is a Python wrapper for [`light-curve-dmdt` Rust crate](https://crates.io/crates/light-curve-dmdt).

```python
import numpy as np
from light_curve import DmDt
from numpy.testing import assert_array_equal

dmdt = DmDt.from_borders(min_lgdt=0, max_lgdt=np.log10(3), max_abs_dm=3, lgdt_size=2, dm_size=4, norm=[])

t = np.array([0, 1, 2], dtype=np.float32)
m = np.array([0, 1, 2], dtype=np.float32)

desired = np.array(
    [
        [0, 0, 2, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 1],
    ]
)
actual = dmdt.points(t, m)

assert_array_equal(actual, desired)
```
